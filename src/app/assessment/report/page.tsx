/**
 * The Subject's 360 comparison report (issue #9, ADR-0003): their own profile
 * against the equal-weight aggregate of how their Observers see them, unlocking
 * once at least three Observers have responded.
 *
 * Login-gated like the rest of the Self flow — an unauthenticated visitor is
 * routed through sign-in, and a signed-in user who hasn't taken the assessment
 * is sent to start it (there's no Subject profile to compare against yet). The
 * report renders from the Subject's saved words and their Observers' anonymous
 * responses; all scoring runs server-side (ADR-0009).
